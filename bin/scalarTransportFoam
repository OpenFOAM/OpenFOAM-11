# Script
#     scalarTransportFoam
#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that scalarTransportFoam has been superseded
#     and replaced by the more general functions solver module
#     executed by the foamRun application.
#
#     The solver specified by either the subSolver or if not present the solver
#     entry in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the physical fields
#     needed by the functionObjects.  The scalarTransport functionObject is then
#     instantiated from the functions entry in the controlDict and executed in a
#     time-loop also controlled by entries in controlDict and the maxDeltaT()
#     returned by the sub-solver.  See:
#
#         tutorials/incompressibleFluid/pitzDailyScalarTransport

scalarTransportFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general
functions solver module executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver functions

The solver specified by either the subSolver or if not present the solver entry
in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the physical fields needed by the
functionObjects.  The scalarTransport functionObject is then instantiated from
the functions entry in the controlDict and executed in a time-loop also
controlled by entries in controlDict and the maxDeltaT() returned by the
sub-solver.  See:
