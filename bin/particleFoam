# Description
#     Script to inform the user that particleFoam has been superseded
#     and replaced by the more general functions solver module
#     executed by the foamRun application.
#
#     The incompressibleFluid solver specified by either the subSolver or if not
#     present the solver entry in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the
#     physical fields needed by fvModel functionObject in which the clouds
#     fvModel is selected to evolve the Lagrangian particles.  See:

#         tutorials/incompressibleFluid/hopperParticles

particleFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general functions
solver module executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver functions

The incompressibleFluid solver specified by either the subSolver or if not
present the solver entry in the controlDict is instantiated to provide the
physical fields needed by fvModel functionObject in which the clouds fvModel is
selected to evolve the Lagrangian particles.  See:
