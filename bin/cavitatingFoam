# Description
#     Script to inform the user that cavitatingFoam has been superseded

cat <<EOF

cavitatingFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general
compressibleVoF solver module executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver compressibleVoF

The cavitatingFoam cases must be upgraded before running the compressibleVoF
solver module, for example the tutorials/compressibleVoF/throttle case
has been converted from the tutorials/multiphase/cavitatingFoam/RAS/throttle
case.
