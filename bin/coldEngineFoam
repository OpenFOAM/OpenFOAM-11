# Script
#     coldEngineFoam
#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that coldEngineFoam has been replaced by the
#     more general fluid solver module.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat << EOF

The coldEngineFoam solver has solver has been replaced by the more general
fluid solver module, which supports engine mesh motion using an appropriate
fvMeshMover. e.g. layeredEngine

To run a coldEngineFoam case with

    foamRun -solver fluid

add a mover entry in constant/dynamicMeshDict
e.g. from the tutorials/fluid/RAS/kivaTest case:

mover
{
    type            layeredEngine;

    libs            ("libfvMeshMovers.so");

    conRodLength    0.147;
    bore            0.092;
    stroke          0.08423;
    clearance       0.00115;
    pistonLayers    0;
}
