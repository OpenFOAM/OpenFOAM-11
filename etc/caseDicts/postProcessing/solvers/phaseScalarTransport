Description
    Solves a transport equation for a scalar field within one phase of a
    multiphase simulation.

    The name of the scalar field is specified in this file. A field file of
    this name will also be required, typically in the 0 directory. Scheme and
    solver settings will also be needed. Alternatively, if there is another
    field which already has appropriate fvSchemes and fvSolution entries, these
    settings can be reused by naming the field as the schemesField.
